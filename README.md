# SmashSite

After hosting several Super Smash Weeklies at my house over the summer, I decided to put all of the info into a database and display the information onto a website. 

### Future Implementation

In the near future, I intend to change the current structure of this project from EJS frontend templates to Angular.js and cleaning up the code.
